# Reboot Ultimate

## What's Different?

- Added several custom commands, such as cheat godall, cheat fly, cheat getlocation, and much more!
- Added multiple shortcut ways to type existing commands! Try things like: cheat bot, cheat health, cheat to, and others.
- Added a new way to give yourself items without having to use a script! Typing "cheat grant" and the item you want's name and rarity (if a weapon) will give you the gun! Ex: "cheat grant rocket_sr"
- Added a new UI section called "Calender Events", which can be used for snow maps, water levels, or even mid-game events if you're on the right version.
- Several bugs from Project Reboot have been fixed on Reboot Ultimate such as 9.10 volcano, 9.40 live event, and working bots on versions before 9!
- When injecting the DLL, all buttons you'll need are already selected (besides gamemode), as well as the amount of time it takes to start has been increased from 5 seconds to 15.
- Lategame now gives completely random weapons! This means that every player has a unique loadout, allowing you to fight with unique weapons each round. (note: the weapons chosen for ranodmization are made for chapter 1, meaning no chapter 2+ items are added yet)

## To Do:

- Vehicle Command - DONE
- Remove Trash Islands & Fishing Holes on S13 - Keep dreaming (actually maybe who knows)
- Fix Vehicle Crash on versions < 8 - If you know how, sure
- Add Pickaxe Stutter (we might have what causes it now) - (We don't)

do most of this and I think we can release ngl
