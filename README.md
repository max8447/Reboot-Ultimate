# Reboot Ultimate

## What's Different?

- Added several custom commands, such as cheat godall, cheat healthall/shieldall, cheat getlocation, and more!
- Added multiple shortcut ways to type existing commands! Try things like: cheat bot, cheat health, cheat to, and others.
- Added a new way to give yourself items without having to use a script! Typing "cheat grant" and the item you want's name and rarity (if a weapon) will give you the gun! Ex: "cheat grant rocket_sr"
- Added a new UI section called "Calender Events", which can be used for snow maps, or water levels if on the right version.
- Several things from Project Reboot have been fixed in this version such as 9.10 volcano, 9.40 live event, and working bots on versions before 9!
- When injecting the DLL, all buttons you'll need are already selected (besides gamemode), as well as the amount of time it takes to start has been increased from 5 seconds to 15.
- Lategame loot automatically starts up with all of the Ammo, Materials, and Traps you'd ever need in order to play! Hop in and start trickshotting immedietely!

## To Do:

- Remove (or fix) Trash Islands on season 13, also *maybe* remove fishing holes if s13
- Fix Vehicle Crash on versions < 8
- Backbling, Glider, and Wrap Commands
- cheat hero gives icon as well.
- Add stutter (we might have what causes it now)
