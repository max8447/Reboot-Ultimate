	// 
	//       The LIST command returns a subset of names from the complete set
	//       of all names available to the client.  Zero or more untagged LIST
	//       replies are returned, containing the name attributes, hierarchy
	//       delimiter, and name; see the description of the LIST reply for
	//       more detail.
	// 
	//       An empty ("" string) reference name argument indicates that the
	//       mailbox name is interpreted as by SELECT.  The returned mailbox
	//       names MUST match the supplied mailbox name pattern.  A non-empty
	//       reference name argument is the name of a mailbox or a level of
	//       mailbox hierarchy, and indicates the context in which the mailbox
	//       name is interpreted.
	// 
	//       An empty ("" string) mailbox name argument is a special request to
	//       return the hierarchy delimiter and the root name of the name given
	//       in the reference.  The value returned as the root MAY be the empty
	//       string if the reference is non-rooted or is an empty string.  In
	//       all cases, a hierarchy delimiter (or NIL if there is no hierarchy)
	//       is returned.  This permits a client to get the hierarchy delimiter
	//       (or find out that the mailbox names are flat) even when no
	//       mailboxes by that name currently exist.
	// 
	//       The reference and mailbox name arguments are interpreted into a
	//       canonical form that represents an unambiguous left-to-right
	//       hierarchy.  The returned mailbox names will be in the interpreted
	//       form.
	// 
	//            Note: The interpretation of the reference argument is
	//            implementation-defined.  It depends upon whether the
	//            server implementation has a concept of the "current
	//            working directory" and leading "break out characters",
	//            which override the current working directory.
	// 
	//            For example, on a server which exports a UNIX or NT
	//            filesystem, the reference argument contains the current
	//            working directory, and the mailbox name argument would
	//            contain the name as interpreted in the current working
	//            directory.
	// 
	//            If a server implementation has no concept of break out
	//            characters, the canonical form is normally the reference
	//            name appended with the mailbox name.  Note that if the
	//            server implements the namespace convention (section
	//            5.1.2), "#" is a break out character and must be treated
	//            as such.
	// 
	//            If the reference argument is not a level of mailbox
	//            hierarchy (that is, it is a \NoInferiors name), and/or
	//            the reference argument does not end with the hierarchy
	//            delimiter, it is implementation-dependent how this is
	//            interpreted.  For example, a reference of "foo/bar" and
	//            mailbox name of "rag/baz" could be interpreted as
	//            "foo/bar/rag/baz", "foo/barrag/baz", or "foo/rag/baz".
	//            A client SHOULD NOT use such a reference argument except
	//            at the explicit request of the user.  A hierarchical
	//            browser MUST NOT make any assumptions about server
	//            interpretation of the reference unless the reference is
	//            a level of mailbox hierarchy AND ends with the hierarchy
	//            delimiter.
	// 
	//       Any part of the reference argument that is included in the
	//       interpreted form SHOULD prefix the interpreted form.  It SHOULD
	//       also be in the same form as the reference name argument.  This
	//       rule permits the client to determine if the returned mailbox name
	//       is in the context of the reference argument, or if something about
	//       the mailbox argument overrode the reference argument.  Without
	//       this rule, the client would have to have knowledge of the server's
	//       naming semantics including what characters are "breakouts" that
	//       override a naming context.
	// 
	//            For example, here are some examples of how references
	//            and mailbox names might be interpreted on a UNIX-based
	//            server:
	// 
	//                Reference     Mailbox Name  Interpretation
	//                ------------  ------------  --------------
	//                ~smith/Mail/  foo.*         ~smith/Mail/foo.*
	//                archive/      %             archive/%
	//                #news.        comp.mail.*   #news.comp.mail.*
	//                ~smith/Mail/  /usr/doc/foo  /usr/doc/foo
	//                archive/      ~fred/Mail/*  ~fred/Mail/*
	// 
	//            The first three examples demonstrate interpretations in
	//            the context of the reference argument.  Note that
	//            "~smith/Mail" SHOULD NOT be transformed into something
	//            like "/u2/users/smith/Mail", or it would be impossible
	//            for the client to determine that the interpretation was
	//            in the context of the reference.
	// 
	//       The character "*" is a wildcard, and matches zero or more
	//       characters at this position.  The character "%" is similar to "*",
	//       but it does not match a hierarchy delimiter.  If the "%" wildcard
	//       is the last character of a mailbox name argument, matching levels
	//       of hierarchy are also returned.  If these levels of hierarchy are
	//       not also selectable mailboxes, they are returned with the
	//       \Noselect mailbox name attribute (see the description of the LIST
	//       response for more details).
	// 
	//       Server implementations are permitted to "hide" otherwise
	//       accessible mailboxes from the wildcard characters, by preventing
	//       certain characters or names from matching a wildcard in certain
	//       situations.  For example, a UNIX-based server might restrict the
	//       interpretation of "*" so that an initial "/" character does not
	//       match.
	//

	//       mailbox name arguments with wildcards as described above.  The
	//       criteria for omitting INBOX is whether SELECT INBOX will return
	//       failure; it is not relevant whether the user's real INBOX resides

	//       or more search keys.  The untagged SEARCH response from the server
	//       contains a listing of message sequence numbers corresponding to
	//       those messages that match the searching criteria.
	// 
	//       When multiple keys are specified, the result is the intersection
	//       (AND function) of all the messages that match those keys.  For
	//       example, the criteria DELETED FROM "SMITH" SINCE 1-Feb-1994 refers
	//       to all deleted messages from Smith that were placed in the mailbox
	//       since February 1, 1994.  A search key can also be a parenthesized
	//       list of one or more search keys (e.g., for use with the OR and NOT
	//       keys).
	// 
	//       Server implementations MAY exclude [MIME-IMB] body parts with
	//       terminal content media types other than TEXT and MESSAGE from
	//       consideration in SEARCH matching.
	// 
	//       The OPTIONAL [CHARSET] specification consists of the word
	//       "CHARSET" followed by a registered [CHARSET].  It indicates the
	//       [CHARSET] of the strings that appear in the search criteria.
	//       [MIME-IMB] content transfer encodings, and [MIME-HDRS] strings in
	//       [RFC-2822]/[MIME-IMB] headers, MUST be decoded before comparing
	//       text in a [CHARSET] other than US-ASCII.  US-ASCII MUST be
	//       supported; other [CHARSET]s MAY be supported.
	// 
	//       If the server does not support the specified [CHARSET], it MUST
	//       return a tagged NO response (not a BAD).  This response SHOULD
	//       contain the BADCHARSET response code, which MAY list the
	//       [CHARSET]s supported by the server.
	// 
	//       In all search keys that use strings, a message matches the key if
	//       the string is a substring of the field.  The matching is
	//       case-insensitive.
	// 
	//       The defined search keys are as follows.  Refer to the Formal

	CkMessageSet *Search(const char *criteria, bool bUid);

	// Searches the already selected mailbox for messages that match criteria and returns a
	// message set of all matching messages. If bUid is true, then UIDs are returned
	// in the message set, otherwise sequence numbers are returned.
	// 
	// Note: It seems that Microsoft IMAP servers, such as outlook.office365.com and
	// imap-mail.outlook.com do not support anything other than 7bit us-ascii chars in
	// the search criteria string, regardless of the SEARCH charset that might be
	// specified.
	// 
	// The criteria is passed through to the low-level IMAP protocol unmodified, so the
	// rules for the IMAP SEARCH command (RFC 3501) apply and are reproduced here:FROM RFC 3501 (IMAP Protocol)
	// 
	//       The SEARCH command searches the mailbox for messages that match
	//       the given searching criteria.  Searching criteria consist of one
	//       or more search keys.  The untagged SEARCH response from the server
	//       contains a listing of message sequence numbers corresponding to
	//       those messages that match the searching criteria.
	// 
	//       When multiple keys are specified, the result is the intersection
	//       (AND function) of all the messages that match those keys.  For
	//       example, the criteria DELETED FROM "SMITH" SINCE 1-Feb-1994 refers
	//       to all deleted messages from Smith that were placed in the mailbox
	//       since February 1, 1994.  A search key can also be a parenthesized
	//       list of one or more search keys (e.g., for use with the OR and NOT
	//       keys).
	// 
	//       Server implementations MAY exclude [MIME-IMB] body parts with
	//       terminal content media types other than TEXT and MESSAGE from
	//       consideration in SEARCH matching.
	// 
	//       The OPTIONAL [CHARSET] specification consists of the word
	//       "CHARSET" followed by a registered [CHARSET].  It indicates the
	//       [CHARSET] of the strings that appear in the search criteria.
	//       [MIME-IMB] content transfer encodings, and [MIME-HDRS] strings in
	//       [RFC-2822]/[MIME-IMB] headers, MUST be decoded before comparing
	//       text in a [CHARSET] other than US-ASCII.  US-ASCII MUST be
	//       supported; other [CHARSET]s MAY be supported.
	// 
	//       If the server does not support the specified [CHARSET], it MUST
	//       return a tagged NO response (not a BAD).  This response SHOULD
	//       contain the BADCHARSET response code, which MAY list the
	//       [CHARSET]s supported by the server.
	// 
	//       In all search keys that use strings, a message matches the key if
	//       the string is a substring of the field.  The matching is
	//       case-insensitive.
	// 
	//       The defined search keys are as follows.  Refer to the Formal
