	//     secp256r1 (also known as P-256 and prime256v1)
	//     secp384r1 (also known as P-384)
	//     secp521r1 (also known as P-521)
	//     secp256k1 (This is the curve used for Bitcoin)

	// the private key. The encoding is the encoding used for encodedK, which can be "hex",
	// "base64", "decimal", etc.

	// Note: This method is typically used for testing -- such as when the same private
	// key is desired to produce results identical from run to run.
