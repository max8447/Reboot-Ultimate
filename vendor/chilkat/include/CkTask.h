	// always possible to know -- such as for sending email (because the size of the
	// email to be sent is already known). For some methods, it may or may not be

	// ----------------------
	// Methods
	// ----------------------
	// Marks an asynchronous task for cancellation. The expected behavior depends on
	// the current status of the task as described here:
	//     "loaded" - If the task has been loaded but has not yet been queued to run in
	//     the thread pool, then there is nothing to do. (There is nothing to cancel
	//     because the task's Run method has not yet been called.) The task will remain in
	//     the "loaded" state.
	//     "queued" - The task is marked for cancellation, is dequeued, and will not
	//     run. The task's status changes immediately to "canceled".
	//     "running" - The already-running task is marked for cancellation. The task's
	//     status will eventually change to "aborted" when the asynchronous method returns.
	//     At that point in time, the ResultErrorText property will contain the
	//     "LastErrorText" of the method call. In the case where a task is marked for
	//     cancellation just at the time it's completing, the task status may instead
	//     change to "completed".
	//     "canceled", "aborted", "completed" - In these cases the task has already
	//     finished, and there will be no change in status.
	// Cancel returns true if the task was in the "queued" or "running" state when it
	// was marked for cancellation. Cancel returns false if the task was in any other
	// state.
	// 
	// Important: Calling the Cancel method marks a task for cancellation. It sets a
	// flag in memory that the running task will soon notice and then abort. It is
	// important to realize that your application is likely calling Cancel from the
	// main UI thread, whereas the asynchronous task is running in a background thread.
	// If the task was in the "running" state when Cancel was called, it will still be
	// in the "running" state when Cancel returns. It will take a short amount of time
	// until the task actually aborts. This is because operating systems schedule
	// threads in time slices, and the thread needs one or more time slices to notice
	// the cancellation flag and abort. After calling Cancel, your application might
	// wish to call the Wait method to wait until the task has actually aborted, or it
	// could periodically check the task's status and then react once the status
	// changes to "aborted".
	// 
	bool Cancel(void);


	// Removes all entries from the progress info log.
	void ClearProgressLog(void);


	// Returns the binary bytes result of the task. The bytes are copied to the caller.

	// Node's internal thread pool. If no callback function is passed, then the task is
	// run synchronously. Queues the task to run on the internal Chilkat thread pool.

	void SleepMs(int numMs);

	// milliseconds have elapsed. (A maxWaitMs value of 0 is to wait indefinitely.) Returns
	// (false) if the task has not yet been started by calling the Run method, or if
	// the maxWaitMs expired. If the task completed, was already completed, was canceled or
	// aborted, then this method returns true.
