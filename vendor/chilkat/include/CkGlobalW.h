	//     are running.

	// string, such as "Hello", in bundleUnlockCode. If a license is purchased, then replace the
	// "Hello" with the purchased unlock code.
	// 
	// After calling UnlockBundle once, the instance of the CLASS_NAME object may be
	// discarded/deleted (assuming the programming language requires explicit deletes).
	// Multiple calls to UnlockComponent are harmless. If the Chilkat API is already
	// unlocked, the duplicate calls to UnlockBundle are no-ops.
	// 
	// Important: Unlocking sets a flag in memory to indicate the unlocked status.
	// There are no licensing files, and there is no communication with any Chilkat
	// servers. This means your application, script, etc. must call UnlockBundle once
	// at the start each time it runs. The good thing is that your application can run
	// on any computer -- there are no licensing files to worry about. Also: If an
	// application forgets to call UnlockBundle, Chilkat will automatically unlock in
	// trial mode, and this will eventually fail when the trial runs out. If you
	// purchased a license, it is very important to make sure you call UnlockBundle
	// with the purchased unlock code.
