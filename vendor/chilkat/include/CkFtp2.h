	//                      "l" / "m" / "p" / "r" / "w"
	// 
	//    There are ten permission indicators currently defined.  Many are
	//    meaningful only when used with a particular type of object.  The
	//    indicators are case independent, "d" and "D" are the same indicator.
	// 
	//    The "a" permission applies to objects of type=file, and indicates
	//    that the APPE (append) command may be applied to the file named.
	// 
	//    The "c" permission applies to objects of type=dir (and type=pdir,
	//    type=cdir).  It indicates that files may be created in the directory
	//    named.  That is, that a STOU command is likely to succeed, and that
	//    STOR and APPE commands might succeed if the file named did not
	//    previously exist, but is to be created in the directory object that
	//    has the "c" permission.  It also indicates that the RNTO command is
	//    likely to succeed for names in the directory.
	// 
	//    The "d" permission applies to all types.  It indicates that the
	//    object named may be deleted, that is, that the RMD command may be
	//    applied to it if it is a directory, and otherwise that the DELE
	//    command may be applied to it.
	// 
	//    The "e" permission applies to the directory types.  When set on an
	//    object of type=dir, type=cdir, or type=pdir it indicates that a CWD
	//    command naming the object should succeed, and the user should be able
	//    to enter the directory named.  For type=pdir it also indicates that
	//    the CDUP command may succeed (if this particular pathname is the one
	//    to which a CDUP would apply.)
	// 
	//    The "f" permission for objects indicates that the object named may be
	//    renamed - that is, may be the object of an RNFR command.
	// 
	//    The "l" permission applies to the directory file types, and indicates
	//    that the listing commands, LIST, NLST, and MLSD may be applied to the
	//    directory in question.
	// 
	//    The "m" permission applies to directory types, and indicates that the
	//    MKD command may be used to create a new directory within the
	//    directory under consideration.
	// 
	//    The "p" permission applies to directory types, and indicates that
	//    objects in the directory may be deleted, or (stretching naming a
	//    little) that the directory may be purged.  Note: it does not indicate
	//    that the RMD command may be used to remove the directory named
	//    itself, the "d" permission indicator indicates that.
	// 
	//    The "r" permission applies to type=file objects, and for some
	//    systems, perhaps to other types of objects, and indicates that the
	//    RETR command may be applied to that object.
	// 
	//    The "w" permission applies to type=file objects, and for some
	//    systems, perhaps to other types of objects, and indicates that the
	//    STOR command may be applied to the object named.
	// 
	//    Note: That a permission indicator is set can never imply that the
	//       appropriate command is guaranteed to work -- just that it might.
	//       Other system specific limitations, such as limitations on
	//       available space for storing files, may cause an operation to fail,
	//       where the permission flags may have indicated that it was likely
	//       to succeed.  The permissions are a guide only.
	// 
	//    Implementation note: The permissions are described here as they apply
	//       to FTP commands.  They may not map easily into particular
	//       permissions available on the server's operating system.  Servers
	//       are expected to synthesize these permission bits from the
	//       permission information available from operating system.  For
	//       example, to correctly determine whether the "D" permission bit
	//       should be set on a directory for a server running on the UNIX(TM)
	//       operating system, the server should check that the directory named
	//       is empty, and that the user has write permission on both the
	//       directory under consideration, and its parent directory.
	// 
	//       Some systems may have more specific permissions than those listed
	//       here, such systems should map those to the flags defined as best
	//       they are able.  Other systems may have only more broad access
	//       controls.  They will generally have just a few possible
	//       permutations of permission flags, however they should attempt to
	// correctly represent what is permitted.

	// A "perm fact" is returned. The format of the perm fact is defined in RFC 3659 as

	// 
	//    There are ten permission indicators currently defined.  Many are
	//    meaningful only when used with a particular type of object.  The
	//    indicators are case independent, "d" and "D" are the same indicator.
	// 
	//    The "a" permission applies to objects of type=file, and indicates
	//    that the APPE (append) command may be applied to the file named.
	// 
	//    The "c" permission applies to objects of type=dir (and type=pdir,
	//    type=cdir).  It indicates that files may be created in the directory
	//    named.  That is, that a STOU command is likely to succeed, and that
	//    STOR and APPE commands might succeed if the file named did not
	//    previously exist, but is to be created in the directory object that
	//    has the "c" permission.  It also indicates that the RNTO command is
	//    likely to succeed for names in the directory.
	// 
	//    The "d" permission applies to all types.  It indicates that the
	//    object named may be deleted, that is, that the RMD command may be
	//    applied to it if it is a directory, and otherwise that the DELE
	//    command may be applied to it.
	// 
	//    The "e" permission applies to the directory types.  When set on an
	//    object of type=dir, type=cdir, or type=pdir it indicates that a CWD
	//    command naming the object should succeed, and the user should be able
	//    to enter the directory named.  For type=pdir it also indicates that
	//    the CDUP command may succeed (if this particular pathname is the one
	//    to which a CDUP would apply.)
	// 
	//    The "f" permission for objects indicates that the object named may be
	//    renamed - that is, may be the object of an RNFR command.
	// 
	//    The "l" permission applies to the directory file types, and indicates
	//    that the listing commands, LIST, NLST, and MLSD may be applied to the
	//    directory in question.
	// 
	//    The "m" permission applies to directory types, and indicates that the
	//    MKD command may be used to create a new directory within the
	//    directory under consideration.
	// 
	//    The "p" permission applies to directory types, and indicates that
	//    objects in the directory may be deleted, or (stretching naming a
	//    little) that the directory may be purged.  Note: it does not indicate
	//    that the RMD command may be used to remove the directory named
	//    itself, the "d" permission indicator indicates that.
	// 
	//    The "r" permission applies to type=file objects, and for some
	//    systems, perhaps to other types of objects, and indicates that the
	//    RETR command may be applied to that object.
	// 
	//    The "w" permission applies to type=file objects, and for some
	//    systems, perhaps to other types of objects, and indicates that the
	//    STOR command may be applied to the object named.
	// 
	//    Note: That a permission indicator is set can never imply that the
	//       appropriate command is guaranteed to work -- just that it might.
	//       Other system specific limitations, such as limitations on
	//       available space for storing files, may cause an operation to fail,
	//       where the permission flags may have indicated that it was likely
	//       to succeed.  The permissions are a guide only.
	// 
	//    Implementation note: The permissions are described here as they apply
	//       to FTP commands.  They may not map easily into particular
	//       permissions available on the server's operating system.  Servers
	//       are expected to synthesize these permission bits from the
	//       permission information available from operating system.  For
	//       example, to correctly determine whether the "D" permission bit
	//       should be set on a directory for a server running on the UNIX(TM)
	//       operating system, the server should check that the directory named
	//       is empty, and that the user has write permission on both the
	//       directory under consideration, and its parent directory.
	// 
	//       Some systems may have more specific permissions than those listed
	//       here, such systems should map those to the flags defined as best
	//       they are able.  Other systems may have only more broad access
	//       controls.  They will generally have just a few possible
