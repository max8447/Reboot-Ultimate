	// Adds entropy to the PRNG (i.e. adds more seed material to the PRNG). Entropy can
	// be obtained by calling GetEntropy, or the application might have its own sources
	// for obtaining entropy. An application may continue to add entropy at desired
	// intervals. How the entropy is used depends on the PRNG algorithm. For Fortuna,
	// the entropy is added to the internal entropy pools and used when internal
	// automatic reseeding occurs.
	// 
	// An application may add non-random entropy for testing purposes. This allows for
	// the reproduction of the same pseudo-random number sequence for testing and
	// debugging purposes.
	// 
	// The entropy bytes are passed in entropy using the binary encoding specified in
	// encoding. Binary encodings can be "hex", "base64", etc. See the link below for
	// supported binary encodings.

	// restarts it can import what was previously exported by calling ImportEntropy.
	// This ensures an adequate amount of entropy is immediately available when first
	// generating random bytes.
	// 
	// For example, an application could persist the exported entropy to a database or
	// file. When the application starts again, it could import the persisted entropy,
	// add some entropy from a system source (via the GetEntropy/AddEntropy methods),
