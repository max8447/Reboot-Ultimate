	// TLS_RSA_WITH_DES_CBC_SHA To restrict SSL/TLS connections to one or more specific
	// ciphers, set this property to a comma-separated list of ciphers such as
	// "TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA384, TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384".
	// The order should be in terms of preference, with the preferred algorithms listed
	// first. (Note that the client cannot specifically choose the algorithm is picked
	// because it is the server that chooses. The client simply provides the server
	// with a list from which to choose.)
	// 
	// The property can also disallow connections with servers having certificates with
	// RSA keys less than a certain size. By default, server certificates having RSA
	// keys of 512 bits or greater are allowed. Add the keyword "rsa1024" to disallow
	// connections with servers having keys smaller than 1024 bits. Add the keyword
	// "rsa2048" to disallow connections with servers having keys smaller than 2048
	// bits.
	// 
	// Note: Prior to Chilkat v9.5.0.55, it was not possible to explicitly list allowed
	// cipher suites. The deprecated means for indicating allowed ciphers was both
	// incomplete and unprecise. For example, the following keywords could be listed to
	// allow matching ciphers: "aes256-cbc", "aes128-cbc", "3des-cbc", and "rc4". These
	// keywords will still be recognized, but programs should be updated to explicitly
	// list the allowed ciphers.
	// 
	// secure-renegotiation: Starting in Chilkat v9.5.0.55, the keyword
	// "secure-renegotiation" may be added to require that all renegotions be done
	// securely (as per RFC 5746).
	// 
	// best-practices: Starting in Chilkat v9.5.0.55, this property may be set to the
	// single keyword "best-practices". This will allow ciphers based on the current
	// best practices. As new versions of Chilkat are released, the best practices may
	// change. Changes will be noted here. The current best practices are:
	// 
	//     If the server uses an RSA key, it must be 1024 bits or greater.
	//     All renegotations must be secure renegotiations.
	//     All ciphers using RC4, DES, or 3DES are disallowed.
	// 
	// Example: The following string would restrict to 2 specific cipher suites,
	// require RSA keys to be 1024 bits or greater, and require secure renegotiations:
	// "TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA256, TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA, rsa1024,

	// The hostname can be a domain name (i.e. example.com), an IPv4 dotted address string
	// such as "3.101.18.47", or an IPv6 address string such as
	// "2345:0425:2CA1:0000:0000:0567:5673:23b5", or "2345:0425:2CA1::0567:5673:23b5",
	// etc.
	// 
	// To establish an SSL/TLS connection, set ssl = true, otherwise set ssl =
	// false for a normal TCP connection. Note: The timeouts that apply to the
	// internal SSL/TLS handshaking messages are the MaxReadIdleMs and MaxSendIdleMs
	// properties.
	// 
	// Note: The maxWaitMs only applies to the actual TCP connect, i.e. the max time to wait
	// for the TCP connect to be accepted. The MaxReadIdleMs property applies to DNS
	// (if hostname is a domain name), to any SOCKS or HTTP proxy communications, and to
	// SSL/TLS handshake communications.
	// 
	// Note: Connections do not automatically close because of inactivity. A connection
	// will remain open indefinitely even if there is no activity.
	// 
	// Important: All TCP-based Internet communications, regardless of the protocol
	// (such as HTTP, FTP, SSH, IMAP, POP3, SMTP, etc.), and regardless of SSL/TLS,
	// begin with establishing a TCP connection to a remote host:port. External
	// security-related infrastructure such as software firewalls (Windows Firewall),
	// hardware firewalls, anti-virus, at either source or destination (or both) can
	// block the connection. If the connection fails, make sure to check all potential
	// external causes of blockage.
	// 
	// Question: How do I Choose the TLS version, such as 1.2? Answer: The client does
	// not specifically choose the TLS version. In the TLS handshake (which is what
	// occurs internally in this method), the client tells the server the version of
	// the TLS protocol it wishes to use, which should be the highest version is
	// supports. In this case, (at the time of this writing on 22-June-2017) it is TLS
	// 1.2. The server then chooses the TLS version that will actually be used. In most
	// cases it will be TLS 1.2. The client can then choose to accept or reject the
	// connection based on the TLS version chosen by the server. By default, Chilkat
	// will reject anything lower than SSL 3.0 (i.e. SSL 2.0 or lower is rejected). The
	// SslProtocol property can be set to change what is accepted by Chilkat. For
	// example, it can be set to "TLS 1.0 or higher".
