	// 
	// Understanding the IsConnected property: The IsConnected property is the last
	// known state of the TCP connection (either connected or disconnected). This
	// requires some explanation because most developer have incorrect assumptions
	// about TCP connections.
	//     If a TCP connection is established, and neither side is reading or writing
	//     the socket (i.e. both sides are doing nothing), then you can disconnect the
	//     network cable from the computer for any length of time, and then re-connect, and
	//     the TCP connection is not affected.
	//     A TCP connection only becomes disconnected when an attempt is made to
	//     read/write while a network problem exists. If no attempts to read/write occur, a
	//     network problem may arise and then become resolved without affecting the TCP
	//     connection.
	//     If the peer chooses to close its side of the TCP connection, your
	//     application won't magically know about it until you try to do something with the
	//     TCP socket (such as read or write).
	//     A Chilkat API property (as opposed to a method) CANNOT and should not do
	//     something that would cause an application to timeout, hang, etc. Therefore, it
	//     is not appropriate for the IsConnected property to attempt any kind of socket
	//     operation (read/write/peek) on the socket. It simply returns the last known
	//     state of the connection. It may very well be that your network cable is
	//     unplugged and IsConnected returns true because technically, if neither peer is
	//     trying to read/write, the network cable could be plugged back in without
	//     affecting the connection. IsConnected could also return true if the peer has
	//     already closed its side of the connection, because the state of the connection
	//     is only updated after trying to read/write/peek.
	//     To truly know the current connected state (as opposed to the last known
	//     connection state), your application should attempt a network operation that is
	//     appropriate to the protocol. For SFTP, an application could call SendIgnore, and
	//     then check IsConnected.
