	// get set to true if (1) the PongAutoConsume property is true and (2) a Pong
	// frame was consumed within the ReadFrame method.
	// 
	// The purpose of PongAutoConsume and PongConsumed is to eliminate the concern for
	// unanticipated Pong frames in the stream. In the websocket protocol, both sides
	// (client and server) may send Pong frames at any time. In addition, if a Ping
	// frame is sent, the corresponding Pong response frame can arrive at some
	// unanticipated point later in the conversation. It's also possible, if several
	// Ping frames are sent, that a Pong response frame is only sent for the most
	// recent Ping frame. The default behavior of Chilkat's WebSocket API is to
	// auto-consume incoming Pong frames and set this property to true. This allows
	// the application to call a ReadFrame method for whatever application data frame
	// it may be expecting, without needing to be concerned if the next incoming frame
	// is a Pong frame.
